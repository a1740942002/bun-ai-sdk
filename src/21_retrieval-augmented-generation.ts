/**
 * 「Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)」可以想像成一種「帶資料庫」的生成式模型應用。也就是說，當語言模型在生成答案的時候，如果僅僅依賴它在訓練時期看到的內容，可能無法回答一些較新的或較專門領域的問題。RAG 的做法就是先把一些外部資料（例如檔案、文章、資料庫等）透過向量化（embeddings）的方式儲存在一個可檢索的資料庫裡（例如向量資料庫）。

   * I have always been fascinated by creating new things. Before entering college, I devoted most of my free time to painting, primarily landscapes and portraits. My passion for art extended to digital design, which I also explored during my high school years. Additionally, I developed a keen interest in wildlife photography after a family vacation to a national park. This newfound hobby taught me patience and attention to detail, as I waited for hours to capture the perfect shot. Upon graduating high school, I decided to pursue a degree in environmental science. During college, I participated in several research projects focusing on sustainable resource management. I also joined the university's photography club, where I learned different techniques and collaborated with peers on various creative projects. Looking back, I believe my artistic background played a crucial role in shaping my perspective on problem-solving and innovation.
   * 我一直對創造新事物感到著迷。在上大學之前，我將大部分的空閒時間投入在繪畫，主要是風景畫和肖像畫。對藝術的熱愛也延伸到數位設計，這是在我高中期間所探索的領域。此外，在一次家庭旅遊造訪國家公園後，我對野生動物攝影產生了濃厚的興趣。這個新愛好讓我學到了耐心與對細節的關注，因為我常常必須等待好幾個小時才能捕捉到完美的照片。高中畢業後，我決定修讀環境科學系。在大學期間，我參與了多項專注於永續資源管理的研究計劃，同時也加入了學校的攝影社，學習多種技巧並與同儕合作完成各式創意專案。回顧過去，我認為我的藝術背景在塑造我對問題解決與創新的思維上，扮演了關鍵的角色。
